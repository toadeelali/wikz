### Fun (not so fun) facts:

- 🔍 &nbsp;Doing a Google Search for the difference between _substring vs substr_ is something that I've already accepted in my life
- :pencil2: &nbsp;I always fail to type Enviroment... ***Environment** ( always miss the tricky "n" :angry: )
- 🛑 &nbsp;There's no point on the **spaces vs tabs** discussion, everyone knows that the latter is the wrong answer
- 🎯 &nbsp;I have the "never-finishing" issue when working on side-projects
- 🏳️ &nbsp;In the Angular vs React vs Svelte vs Vue framework war I support JavaScript
- 🤮 &nbsp;I hate having to clean up the rest of the food in a kitchen sink
